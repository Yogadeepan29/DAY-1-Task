# What are Objects in JavaScript?
   An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
   A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.
   Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life.

# Creating Objects in JavaScript:
  > By object literal
  > By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)

# Internal Representation of Objects :

  Internally, JavaScript engines use various techniques to represent objects efficiently.

  > Dictionary-based Representation:
     Objects in JavaScript are often implemented using dictionaries (or hash tables), where property names serve as keys, and property values are stored at corresponding hash table entries.
     This allows for dynamic property addition, deletion, and lookup but can result in slower property access compared to more optimized representations.

  > Hidden Classes (or Shapes):
     Some JavaScript engines employ hidden classes or shapes to optimize property access. When an object is created, the engine assigns it a hidden class representing its structure.
     Subsequent objects with the same structure share the same hidden class, allowing the engine to optimize property access by leveraging class-specific optimizations.

  > Inline Caching: 
     To further optimize property access, JavaScript engines use techniques like inline caching, where property access operations are optimized based on the object's hidden class.
     Inline caching reduces the overhead of property lookups by caching property access paths and avoiding costly dictionary lookups whenever possible.

  > Practical Use Cases of Objects
     Objects are ubiquitous in JavaScript programming and find applications across various domains, including web development, data modeling, and application architecture. 
     
# Conclusion :
   Objects are fundamental to JavaScript programming, serving as versatile constructs for organizing, manipulating, and representing data and behavior.
   Understanding the internal representation of objects in JavaScript can help developers write more efficient code and leverage optimization techniques offered by JavaScript engines.
   By mastering objects and their usage patterns, developers can unlock the full potential of JavaScript for building robust and scalable applications across various domains.
   In summary, objects are the building blocks of JavaScript, empowering developers to create sophisticated software solutions that harness the full power of the language.
   Whether you're building web applications, data-intensive systems, or client-side utilities, a solid understanding of objects and their internal representation is essential for mastering JavaScript development.
